# Practical Applications of Meta Programming in Ruby

1. DSL
2. ActiveRecords
3. Sinatra for building & maintaining web apps

## DSL

Ruby’s metaprogramming capabilities enable the creation of DSLs, which are specialized mini-languages tailored for specific domains. This allows for more expressive and concise code, particularly useful in configuration and templating tasks.

## ActiveRecords

Metaprogramming in Ruby is extensively used in ActiveRecords to dynamically define methods and associations based on database schema. This results in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase, as it reduces the need for boilerplate code.

## Sinatra

In Sinatra, Ruby’s metaprogramming is utilized to define routes and handlers in a declarative manner. This simplifies the process of building and maintaining web applications by allowing developers to write more natural and readable code.
